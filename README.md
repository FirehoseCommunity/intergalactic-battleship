## Developer Notes:

* [Skipping a build in CodeShip CI](https://codeship.com/documentation/continuous-integration/skipping-builds/): You can add `--skip-ci` to the commit message of the last commit before you push and that push will be ignored. When you merge a pull request you can add the `--skip-ci` to the commit message to ignore the PR merge (not sure how this works for merging on github web interface). `[skip-ci]` DOES NOT WORK!
